Commiting:
Coding style.
We are following Google C++ Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
with few exceptions described below.

File naming: *.cpp, *.hpp

Licenses:
LGPL for new files.
If you add an external code or resources you should check that licence allows it.
Even if file's licence don't forces (for example CC_0) you should specify their
licence and (if possible) link to the source and author.
For binary files add this info in sources_list.txt in same folder.

Formatting:
Manual code formatting consumes a lot of time and is error-prone.
So we have decided to use clang-format tool instead.
Before commiting you should call:

clang-format -i -style=file <FILE_THAT_YOU_CHANGED>

"-style=file" option will use our .clang-format config if you are inside project
folder or subfolder.

Prefered way is to integrate it to your editor or git hooks.
For vim you could use https://github.com/google/vim-codefmt with style configured
to "file".
